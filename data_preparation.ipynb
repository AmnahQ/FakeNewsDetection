Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images\",\n          \"Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life. So he said those things under oath,  Karl began.  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events? One hundred percent,  Trump replied.  I didn t say under oath   I hardly know the man. I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other. If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury. And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him. Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience. But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey. In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him. If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility. He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday Washington was  very concerned  by reports of violence around the Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, which was seized by Baghdad s forces from Kurds.

              "['an electrical contractor wrote to the  year old host of  dirty jobs  to say that he finds it offensive when the media constantly refers to majority of the republican nominee s supporters as  uneducated white men  if the media is referring to trump supporters who happen to be male caucasians suffering from a lack of knowledge brought about by an absence of formal or practical instruction  than i guess  uneducated white men  is a fair description   rowe responded in a lengthy facebook post   however  if the trump supporters in question are being dubbed  uneducated   simply because they didn t earn a four year degree  i d say the media s slip is showing  let s assume that donald trump is indeed popular among white men who didn t graduate from college  the first question is  so what  is this information newsworthy  obviously  thousands of journalists think it is  to your point  the words  uneducated white men  now appear in hundreds of articles about trump  but if this is truly important information  where were these reporters four years ago  in the last election  an even greater majority of african american males who voted for president obama had no college on their resume  maybe i missed it  but i don t recall any headlines or articles that delved into obama s popularity among  uneducated black men  if the media didn t care about the lack of college among black men supporting obama  why do they care so much about the lack of college among white men supporting trump  moreover  when exactly did a lack of college become synonymous with a lack of education  there are many ways to become educated that don t involve the purchase of a diploma  why would the media ignore thousands of apprenticeship programs  on the job training opportunities  and all the other alternative educational options that have led so many people into so many successful careers  the answer is obvious   many in the press are looking for ways to impact the election  if a biased reporter can get away with labeling trump supporters who didn t graduate from college as  uneducated   he can simultaneously imply that any ballot cast for trump is the hallmark of an  uneducated  voter  it s impossible for me to have this conversation and not think of my grandfather  pop never made it to college  in fact  he never made it out of the th grade  but he never stopped learning or studying  he started as an electrician s helper  became an apprentice  a journeyman  a master electrician  a contractor  and then a small business owner  later  as an electrical inspector for the state  he was responsible for guaranteeing the safety of hundreds of buildings in maryland  as well as all the rides on the carnival midway at the state fair  he was a modest man of real intelligence  admired and respected by everyone who knew him  but today  he d be right there with you  albert   swelling out the ranks of  uneducated white men  closing the skills gap and making college more affordable is beyond my pay grade  but it seems like we could start by reminding the media that a college degree is not the only path to success  it s well and good to promote higher education  but it s crazy to suggest the most expensive road to enlightenment is the best path for the most people  and it s equally nuts to pressure our kids to keep borrowing vast sums of money to become  educated  in careers that no longer exist  the media has minimized your work  insulted your intelligence  and ignored your contribution to civilized life  try not to take it personally  just keep doing what you do  run your business  vote your conscience  keep the lights on for the rest of us  read more  daily caller',\n",

presidential election in november   wikileaks revealed a new string of emails connected to hillary clinton s  campaign chairman  john podesta  online interpretations of the leaked podesta email exchanges subsequently led to a digital firestorm on social media  producing an intense conspiratorial  open source investigation  still in search of its smoking gun  however  the phenomenon now known by its hashtag  pizzagate has since set a number of tertiary events into motion  is there a real story hidden amongst the debris of this online explosion is it possible that  open source investigators  were being led into a virtual cul de sac and thus missing the real story more importantly  could people be playing into the hands of the very establishment they seek to depose let s investigate   shock   awe    over the past month  the dc based restaurant comet ping pong  along with besta pizza  to a lesser degree austin s east side pies  has been the subject of a peculiar internet based conspiracy   photo illustration shawn helton of wire context  podesta emails  false hacks   conspiracywhile many of the leaked podesta emails  including the really important one admitting that us partners qatar and saudi arabia are giving funding and  logistical support  of isis  caused a major stir in the run up to the  election  few wikileaks releases have attracted more attention then the podesta emails associated with the internet based conspiracy dubbed  pizzagate  in fact  since the release of the so called  pizzagate  emails  a bundle of leaks and media reports associated with the clintons political pay for play allegations  as well as the shocking admission regarding voter fraud from disgraced democratic national committee consultant robert creamer prior to the  presidential election  have all but disappeared from the mainstream narrative  very convenient  if you are part of the democratic party establishment remember that all of this was taking place right after the mainstream media along with the white house  set the stage for a massive pr push implicating russia as a disrupting force for evil in the us presidential election   allegedly through kremlin sponsored hacking of us democratic institutions and through  sophisticated russian propaganda  in august  the western media s claims against russia hit overdrive  when the  new york times s moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month  but so far  there is no evidence that the hackers  believed to be russian  were successful  flash forward to september here and here  as well as early october in the lead up to president obama s russian hack decree  the clinton friendly outlet  the ny times  had all but solidified the russian cyber hack claims   but once again  without any definitive evidence or proof throw in another american  october surprise  in the form distributed denial of service  ddos  attacks  renewed calls for the stop online piracy act  sopa  internet  led to so called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on america  because of the inability to pass sopa   in effect  reigniting the previously stalled sopa in washington dc  along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media the media clips on youtube below illustrate the kind of duplicitous double speak regarding the  election rigging  that has become a hallmark of the obama administration and establishment washington following  s us presidential election cycle  a russian election hack theory gained even more media traction  orbiting the political realm like a low hanging fruit  propelled by president obama and now the cia  both conflicting with the fbi s assessment in october   dovetailing with the first grumblings that  fake news  had somehow decided the us presidential election in favor of one candidate  donald trump  these are serious accusations that have still failed to yield any solid forensic results from the intelligence community is this mere political gamesmanship  or is there more at work could this all be covering up and diverting the public away from some other explosive events   lolita express    in   jeffery epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution  image source  miamibeachadvocate com as internet researches battle with mainstream media over allegations in  pizzagate  another potentially much bigger story became buried under the digital avalanche  if this is indeed the case  then who benefits the  lolita express  scandalseemingly even more unsettling and disturbing in   was the vastly underreported  lolita express  scandal swirling around the clinton campaign in   jeffery epstein  a billionaire hedge fund mogul who is also a member of the trilateral commission and the council on foreign relations  as well as playing a role in the formation of the clinton global initiative   effectively walked free even though a  page indictment could have landed him in prison for  years according to reports  epstein s  gatsbyesque  persona once described by new york magazine  has long since given way to a new profile as a convicted sex offender  a superstar who was now condemned by a litany of legal troubles due to reports of ghastly serial abuse during the past decade however  during this year s election cycle  coverage concerning new details associated with epstein s private island  little st  james  and allegations of sex slave entertainment enterprise there  was virtually buried by the us corporate media the drop in wall to wall coverage from the tongue tied mainstream media was most likely due to epstein s close affiliation to former president bill clinton  who according flight manifests and other supporting evidence  took  at least  trips aboard the  lolita express    even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights  according to records obtained by foxnews com  it doesn t stop there either  other high profile names linked to the epstein case included former democratic governor bill richardson  kurt cobain widow courtney love  prominent celebrity lawyer  israeli advocate and harvard law professor alan dershowitz  british royal prince andrew  former israeli prime minister ehud barak  and even president elect donald trump   the black book     epstein flight records and  a little black book  paint a very intriguing picture   image source  gawker interestingly  the epstein case was covered heavily by gawker   a news outlets which is now facing bankruptcy following a defamation case won by hulk hogan  terrence gene bollea  over the controversial publication of the wrestling icon s sex tape  hogan s legal victory  took gawker out  but could the real reason have been its epstein coverage  here s some of what gawker said about the epstein case  donald trump  courtney love  former israeli prime minister ehud barak  and uber lawyer alan dershowitz may have been identified by a butler as potential  material witnesses  to pedophile billionaire jeffrey epstein s crimes against young girls  according to a copy of epstein s little black book obtained by gawker an annotated copy of the address book  which also contains entries for alec baldwin  ralph fiennes  griffin dunne  new york post gossip richard johnson  ted kennedy  david koch  filmmaker andrew jarecki  and all manner of other people you might expect a billionaire to know  turned up in court proceedings after epstein s former house manager alfredo rodriguez tried to sell it in   about  of the entries  including those of many of epstein s suspected victims and accomplices as well as trump  love  barak  dershowitz  and others  were circled by rodriguez   the existence of the book has been previously reported by the daily mail  gawker is publishing it in full here for the first time  we have redacted addresses  telephone numbers  email addresses  and the last names of individuals who may have been underage victims  according to an fbi affidavit  rodriguez described the address book and the information contained within it as the  holy grail  or  golden nugget  to unraveling epstein s sprawling child sex network  epstein reportedly also had additional ties to trump  with both men having on and off again been implicated in a separate jane doe  sexual assault lawsuit that was recently dropped in the us court system  apparently for a third time since  the washington times discusses how other high level clients allegedly used epstein s services   including a member of the british royal family  the following passage is from a report filed in january of   and even post prison  mr  epstein kept up some of these high profile relationships   leading to his most recent emergence in the news  which involves allegations that he provided prince andrew with sexual services from a then  year old american girl  virginia roberts ms  roberts  now   has filed a federal lawsuit in florida against mr  epstein  alleging he forced her to serve as a  sex slave  and paid her    to perform sexual services for the prince  the new york post reported  here s sean stone from rt s watching the hawks interviewing conchita sarnoff  the executive director from the alliance to rescue victims of trafficking to discuss epstein s heinous past another strange turn in the clinton email scandal came late in the election  only days before voters went to the polls  suddenly  it was revealed by media outlets that due to the investigation into the sexting scandal involving disgraced former u s  representative anthony weiner   husband of chief clinton aide huma abedine  fbi director james comey would announce that the agency would be reopening the clinton email probe interestingly  according to a recent interview with breitbart news  hillary clinton herself was alleged to have taken  trips to epstein s little saint james island  according to private security kingpin and blackwater founder erik prince  prior to the election and right after the fbi reopened its investigation into the clintons  before promptly being shut down for a second time   the controversial mercenary made the extraordinary claim it s important for readers to note how explosive this revelation truly was  and yet  not one word from either the mainstream media  or  alternative media   outside of breitbart and few other blogs  on this potentially devastating allegation  prince asserted that the nypd found  way more stuff  within the   recently scrutinized emails  the news reportedly sent shock waves into the upper echelon of the democratic party and the clinton campaign   as the nypd was said to have been ready to hand out indictments  into additional criminal activity  possibly involving money laundering and underage sex  among other illicit activity prince s commentary on the democratic party s apparent corruption was released around the same time as a batch of podesta emails that sent internet sleuths down a pizzagate rabbit hole  prince s claim then seem to be grafted onto the pizzagate theory by some youtube commentators  only without any actual concrete evidence in early   the embattled blackwater  renamed academi  and then xe  founder prince  was the subject of an inquiry that alleged he was involved in a major money laundering scheme with the bank of china in libya  in   prince supposedly setup  frontier services group in  with the help of major chinese investment firm citic group  when you factor in how prince himself became the subject of a major scandal and is now on the offensive  it s hard to know whether his claims are true or just a political ploy aimed at deflecting his own controversy  however  his claims do offer a dark view into a political party that has been in a downward spiral for several years wheat from the chaffwith all of that in mind  for any true investigation to take place  the facts still need to be separated from what might only be innuendo and overt speculation other apparent conspiracies were also brought into the fold during the ascendency of  pizzagate  as social media users seemed to make some startling connections  although without a complete story  the lack of coherence of pizzagate allegations opened the door for some of the usual suspects to come in to steer the conversation away from some potentially damaging connections back to the clintons  establishment gatekeeper publication the daily beast reported the following in the passage below  written by user  pleadingtheyiff   the post attempts to link the clinton campaign to laura silsby  an idaho missionary who served a six month prison sentence in haiti after the organization she founded  new life children s refuge  attempted to transport  haitian children to the dominican republic after the  haiti earthquake the user s primary proof of links between the clintons and silsby   huma abedin was constantly forwarding hillary articles on this woman s organization   the post provides no email sent from clinton to abedin regarding the incident the theory then includes a major error  one of the first things hillary did when she took over the scene in haiti was to get laura off the hook   pleadingtheyiff writes  then links to a website called  abovetopsecret com  silsby wasn t freed and instead remained incarcerated in haiti  where she faced trial and was found guilty  the nine other missionaries jailed alongside her were freed  is it possible that the laura silsby case was buried under endless collateral damage from pizzagate with even more damning american conspiracies in   such as the dnc fraud  violent protests funded by george soros  or the pentagon paying pr firm bell pottinger   million to produce fake terror videos  in addition to the lolita express revelations concerning the clintons in particular  you have to wonder whether the pizzagate theory was an unintended coincidence or if it was yet another socially engineered agenda that masked other media stories what s most obvious  however  is how the pizzagate story and spin off controversies appear to have obfuscated other real criminality contained within the podesta email leaks  while providing a media smoke screen for the conspiracies mentioned directly above in the article below we ll take another look at the pizzagate phenomena  along with comet ping pong s gunman story  in addition to one of washington dc s most notorious scandals  and how the events surrounding the online conspiracy  could be used to shape new censorship protocols in the wake of us media s witch hunt for  fake news  sites   leaked    john podesta former chairman for hillary clinton s  presidential campaign  pictured with clinton chief aid huma abedin on the clinton campaign jet  spirit cooking    pizzagate  a media driven psy op within the contents of the controversial podesta dispatch by wikileaks in early november  there appeared to be a distressing email chain between tony podesta  a top democratic lobbyist of the podesta group  brother of john podesta  hillary clinton s campaign chairman  and a new york city based serbian performance artist named marina abramovic the  email exchange between tony podesta and marina abramovic  image  left  drew a sharp outcry from users on social media platforms like twitter and reddit  after the email conversation revealed a dinner party involving a performance art based ritual calling for the use of real human blood and bodily fluids  referred to as  spirit cooking    while abramovic s occult influenced art could be seen as sick and deeply disturbing to many  and even degenerate depravity to some   it s important to emphasize there was nothing criminal about her email with tony podesta or her dark creations captured on video from as early as two decades ago the origins of abramovic s spirit cooking appeared to some researchers to be linked directly to aleister crowley s  thelma religion  this prompted some alternative media outlets to link to everpedia as their primary source to explain the  truth  behind spirit cooking  the internet based conspiracy ultimately led to increased speculation  turbo charging even more spurious connections another major magnet for pizzagate researchers was abramovic s book published in   the self proclaimed  grandmother  of performance art released a book entitled  spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes    a rare book that contained a sequence of etchings and perverted recipes as theories about spirit cooking exploded on social media  a series of podesta emails were leaked containing what had been thought to be coded language concealing an elite underground child sex ring  according some quasi investigative online sites and mega forums  citing chan and reddit posts in addition  it appears that a series of emails released by wikileaks  here and here  are partially what led to one man  james alefantis  owner of comet ping pong  to become the central pizzagate antagonist  the fact that alefantis is listed as one of dc s top  most influential people   only fuelled speculation that the internet case was  a slam dunk  social media inquisitors shared pictures from the instagram account of alefantis  now blocked to the public  and other friends and contacts linked with him  in an attempt to conclude a vast conspiracy  while many of these images appeared disturbing in the context of the two conspiracies mentioned above  the images themselves did not prove any actual crime had taken place as the conspiracy deepened  symbols from the washington dc restaurant venue comet ping pong  derived from its menu and logo  as well as other pizza restaurants   in addition to apparent coded podesta emails  sparked an outcry on social media as the symbols used appeared to mimic those according to a wikileaks release supposedly from the fbi  the apparent leaked release from the fbi disclosed certain markers in sex trafficking and abuse cases  while there might be similarities in the graphics observed at comet ping pong and nearby besta pizza  the evidence is still purely circumstantial and certainly nothing conclusively linking the dc based pizzerias to any abuse ring  internet trawlers also claimed to have unearthed photos of the digging of a secret basement dungeon underneath comet ping pong   a claim which later turned out to be false note that this one planted detail in the pizzagate story   the evocative image a  secret basement  reserved for child torture and abuse   sent this story into orbit  this is one example of how one or two simple details injected into a storyline can inflame the narrative and motivate forum users beyond what any real forensic investigation could  by creating a virtual crusade in fact  it was revealed that  comet uses a low slung refrigerator at buck s fishing   camping  mr  alefantis s other restaurant two doors down on the same block  to store produce  cheese and proofing dough     see left photo by cecilia kang it s worth noting that chan was also behind one of the most speculative claims surrounding mh  a story that allegedly involved the patent holders of the tech company freescale semiconductor which turned out to be false  conversely  chan has provided some valuable crowd sourced information  like in the wake of the  boston bombing when chan users posted a number of photos indicating the presence of other operatives involved in the event   a point totally blacked out by us authorities and media interestingly  the chan website is said to be  struggling to survive  financially in part because of increased users driven by viral and clickbait like material like pizzagate through hyper speculative and often misleading information spread by social media users  the pizzagate narrative took shape media tripwireas the us media brushed off the perceived content of the podesta emails mentioned above  a ground swell of speculation  hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims filled the vacuum online  as enthusiasm continued unabated it s also important to recognize that one of the main propellers of the initial pizzagate story was a popular disinformation website called your news wire  who regularly feed the public with completely fake news stories online which get propagated through social media  this website has successfully managed to fool many online readers because it will regularly mix real news articles in with its many invented stories  a viral fake story like this would have netted  your news wire  tens of thousands of dollars in ad click revenue buzzfeed reports  on oct    a white supremacy twitter account that presents itself as belonging to a jewish lawyer in new york tweeted that the nypd was looking into evidence that emails from anthony weiner s laptop contained evidence of clinton involvement in an  international child enslavement ring  the next day  oct    sean adl tabatabai  who used to work with british conspiracy theorist david icke  took note of the message board post and the tweet  he wrote a post for his site  yournewswire com  his story took another step by claiming an  fbi insider  had confirmed the claims  where did this this new fbi source come from  adl tabatabai cited a thread on a chan message board from back in july  that thread started when an anonymous user invited questions after describing themself as  a person with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the clinton case    adl tabatabai did not respond to questions sent to him by buzzfeed news   by this point  the story became a viral ball of fire  and there was no stopping it you have to wonder if the spirit cooking pizzagate emails  might have been used as a tripwire by the establishment to initiate increased internet censorship  a story that has gathered a big boost from highly speculative ideas pasted together by various social media personalities on youtube and then codified by large popular  alt media  outlets like infowars com here and here  who levied unconfirmed allegations at comet ping pong restaurant and other private businesses in an affluent area of washington dc few conspiracies in recent years have generated as much public outrage  scrutiny and intense speculation  however  we should question the timing of this conspiracy as it relates to the cyber censorship on the table following the  fake news  crisis the bbc stated the following after a podesta email thread leaked in november  mentioned the alefantis connection  in early november  as wikileaks steadily released piles of emails from clinton s campaign chairman john podesta  one contact caught the attention of prankster sites and people on the paranoid fringes james alefantis is the owner of comet ping pong  a pizza restaurant in washington  he s also a big democratic party supporter and raised money for both barack obama and hillary clinton  he was once in a relationship with david brock  an influential liberal operative alefantis   who s never met clinton   appeared in the podesta emails in connection with the fundraisers  other claims attached to the pizzagate theory included a link to a tweet from the deceased investigative reporter  andrew breitbart  the pizzagate theory seemed to gather steam from this screenshot of an alleged breitbart tweet below   but is there more to the story upon reviewing the origins of the breitbart tweet now intertwined with the pizzagate theory  there appears to be some contention about what breitbart might have been referencing  here s the political blog hot air on the matter  it s a classic andrew tweet  his abbreviations  his invention of words   cover upperer   tells me that this was probably andrew s work  i never really knew him to allow anyone to tweet on his behalf but i suppose it s possible at some point he did so without my knowledge  so  for our discussion let s stipulate that it was andrew who sent this out  what is he talking about  anyone who knew andrew well and worked closely in his sphere and knew what he would talk and tweet about with regard to  underage sex slave s   and john podesta  knows exactly what he is referring to  acorn if you don t remember james o keefe  hanna giles and the acorn story that broke on andrew s big government website in   here s a quick description via wikipedia  which has a lot of bogus takes on the story  but this brief description is correct  in july and august   giles and o keefe visited acorn offices in baltimore  washington  d c   brooklyn  san bernardino  san diego  philadelphia  los angeles  and miami  giles dressed as a prostitute  while o keefe wore white khakis with a blue dress shirt and or tie and claimed to be her boyfriend  giles and o keefe recorded the encounters using hidden cameras and pretended to be seeking advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade  the article goes on to state that the acorn saga  which had been instrumental in breitbart s rise in media  had been in some aspect involved an underage abuse story due to the undercover work of james o keefe and hannah giles   strange days    comet ping pong resides in a quiet affluent dc neighborhood   image source  chicago sun times the comet ping pong gunmanin early december   year old actor edgar maddison welch was arrested by authorities after reportedly discharging a rifle inside alefantis s comet ping pong restaurant  welch had been apparently  self investigating  comet ping pong  the pizzeria at the epicenter of a shocking conspiracy asserting that the establishment is somehow allegedly involved in an expansive child trafficking abuse ring welch s background may have raised a few eyebrows of those who have chronicled the profiles of various gunman in recent years  such as his acting film production past documented on imdb   he was also recently involved in a major traffic accident in october  badly injuring a young teenager  potentially impacting his state of mind  as well as being exposed in a potential criminal case while wire has outlined the possibility of informants being used in shooting events in the past   usually those individuals have had a lengthy criminal past with multiple links to government  military and sometimes the entertainment industry   welch doesn t entirely fit this typical mold of a convict turned informant or agent provocateur perhaps there s another answer the online site heavy com released the following information regarding welch s father and his work preventing child abductions  harry welch jr  is a former police officer  firearms instructor and expert witness on firearms  according to his imdb profile  he also writes that his family has hosted foster children and has worked to prevent child abuse he was   elected president of the north carolina crime stoppers association  two terms   served as executive director for protect a child  a national  non profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children  appointed by governor jim martin to the governor s commission on child victimization  was welch under psychological duress following his recent car accident  feeding into other aspects of his life  such as his father s work to prevent child abuse  then motivated into action by an online conspiracy although it s difficult to accurately gauge welch s true motivation  some youtube personalities absolutely contend that his involvement was scripted    to smear the a new burgeoning  pizzagate research community  online  additionally  some researchers cite welch s relief visit to haiti in   as absolute  proof of a hoax  because alleged clinton foundation ties to human trafficking in haiti   claims that have to this date  have yet to be completely proven this part of the pizzagate conspiracy gained steam when monica petersen  an activist for sex worker rights  who over the summer was working for  claude d estree  the executive director of the human trafficking center at the university of denver   apparently died of a suicide in mid november while in haiti  however  at the time the circumstances of her death were not entirely clear  which led to intense speculation not grounded in fact  if there was evidence of foul play  certainly this could be investigated as part of a possible cover up  especially during such a hotly contested us election involving the clintons   but until that issue is resolved  any talk of  proof  of a wider conspiracy is still just that  talk the petersen tragedy was then grafted onto the pizzagate story the washington post reported the following  according to executive director d estree   petersen had gone to haiti a number of times  but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the clinton foundation  he said she had been a  brilliant  research fellow  working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by siddharth kara  unfortunately  petersen s story got packaged with allegations of a clinton trafficking conspiracy that was then interwoven within the pizzagate theory and on the same day welch walked into comet ping pong  the widely known site infowars com  posted a youtube video titled  haiti pizzagate  death of child trafficking investigator   without actually confirming the full details surrounding petersen s death  everpedia  one of the first websites to explain the details of spirit cooking  appeared to also fan the flames of an alleged conspiracy surrounding petersen s death an abc news release below disclosed the full details regarding welch s apparent criminal activity at comet ping pong  at around  p m   he arrived at the restaurant  where witnesses say they saw welch holding an assault rifle across his chest  according to the complaint  as he moved toward the back of the restaurant  employees and customers fled the building as everyone was fleeing  welch encountered an employee returning from the back freezer  according to court documents  the employee said welch pointed the ar  rifle in his direction  the documents state  but welch denied raising the firearm at the employee after the customers and employees left the restaurant  police created a perimeter around it  and at about   p m  welch exited the building with his hands in the air  complying with officers  the story continued  with the following description  at one point he said he encountered a locked door and attempted to open it with a butter knife  the complaint says  when that didn t work  he fired shots at the lock with his ar   documents say  here s a screen shot of welch s incident report msm fake news witch huntfor the mainstream media  pizzagate was the gift that just kept on giving following welch s encounter inside comet ping pong  the conspiracy known as  pizzagate  has fallen into the manipulative hands of the corporate mainstream media  now castigating  speculative alternative media outlets   which in turn gave legs to the already convoluted  fake news witch hunt being waged by mainstream media   specifically aimed at independent outlets and blogs that regularly produce insightful critical analysis additionally  since the spirit cooking and pizzagate theories were merging  there has been no solid evidence linking the restaurant to anything criminal  yet the theories continue to persist online  implicating private citizens in what is at this point a  victimless  crime  this has made alternative media an easy target for mainstream media and politicians calling for more  control  over social media content to help stop waht mainstream pundits were now describing as pizzagate s own campaign online abuse and  internet bullying  against comet ping pong s owner and staff from a legal stand point  the pizzagate conspiracy could also potentially lead to a court case against the root cause of certain defamatory allegations and apparent death threats   as alefantis and other shop owners are private citizens and not public figures  this is something to consider when presenting any possible theory directly implicating an individual in a major felony  unless there exists a real forensic smoking gun  or a whistleblower willing to come forward then there is no  case    only speculation which could be construed as libel and defamation without any supporting evidence while the internet has zeroed in on pizzeria based conspiracies over the past two months  it s important to remember that washington has had a long dark history linked to illicit prostitution and sex trafficking   including at least two such expansive cases that reached all the way to the white house   disgraced    former us congressman barney frank  frank did not seek re lection in  after he was found to have engineered a   million tarp bailout for oneunited bank   image source  businessinsider com washington s silence  congressman frank s  call boys in   democratic congressman barney frank  decided not to seek re election  while much of the mainstream media waxed poetic about his  year career  there was virtually no mention of his involvement in one of the most notable dc scandals over the past three decades in   it was discovered that frank s then boyfriend stephen gobie  who the us representative once solicited for an   dollar sexual encounter  had been running a prostitution ring out of congressman frank s capitol hill apartment   according to gobie  barney frank was fully aware of the operation here s a passage from a business insider article from  that describes one of dc s darkest scandals that is barely mentioned by media outlets to this day  reuters didn t mention it  the new york times didn t bring it up  the guardian didn t note it either  the washington post got to it in the th paragraph in  it was discovered that barney frank s boyfriend  stephen gobie  whom frank had once hired as a male prostitute  was running a male brothel out of the congressman s home  frank claimed he did not know about the prostitution ring in his home  but he did use the power of his office to  fix   tickets for gobie  and he knowingly wrote a misleading letter to gobie s probation officer in virginia  frank received a  reprimand  for fixing the tickets  gobie maintained that frank knew about the prostitution ring operation in his home  even writers who were absolutely untroubled by the openly homosexual lawmaker in  thought that frank should have resigned  or they at least acknowledged that there was an abuse of his office  additionally  the washington post reported that gobie  maintained a relationship with gabriel a

administrative leave  the conspiracy deepened as the washington post followed up the breaking story providing the following details  with congress in recess  it s too soon to tell if the massachusetts democrat will weather his admission that he paid gobie for sex  hired him as a personal aide and wrote letters on congressional stationary to the convicted felon s probation officer  shockingly  the scandal continued to persist as the investigation led to other political inquiries  frank s scandal appeared to overlap and dovetail with another disturbing ring that reached all the way to the white house during the reagan bush era the franklin cover upthe barney frank scandal indeed followed another appalling and chilling scandal dubbed the  franklin cover up   the shocking case involving omaha  nebraska s franklin credit union employee named lawrence king  who looted his employer to the tune of   million dollars  here s a washington post article from  on the matter  lawrence e  king jr   everyone now agrees  had a remarkable knack for stretching a dollar  on a salary of    a year  the credit union manager drove a    white mercedes   and still could afford to spend    a month on limousines  his credit card charges topped   million  he owned a four story house on  acres overlooking the missouri river  and his floral bill alone came to    during a fragrant   month period in    while king s embezzlement was troublesome  it paled into comparison to a wider charge of trafficking and abuse levied at the credit union manager  the post continued  outlining the awful truth about the abuse tied to king  in a group called the franklin five  in june   a social worker at a mental hospital in omaha reported allegations of possible child abuse to the nebraska foster care review board  an agency that monitors the placement of several thousand children in the state the board subsequently asked omaha police and the state attorney general to investigate possible  child exploitation   a  child prostitution ring  and  inappropriate activities by larry king  more evidence in the same report revealed the following   hours of videotaped testimony from three new witnesses  all in their early twenties  who said that  as minors  they had been victims of physical and sexual abuse  the book entitled the franklin cover up  by former nebraska state senator and lawyer  john de camp  chronicled a case that implicated politicians  judges  those in the military  police  as well as members of the intelligence community in the subsequent abduction of numerous children over the course of many years lawrence king was eventually convicted on charges of theft from the franklin credit union and ordered to pay damages to paul bonacci for the apparent abuse he suffered during his abduction  bonacci later told investigators he had participated in the abduction of johnny gosch  but according to  polk county attorney john sarcone   the des moines resgister   bonacci has said he took part in johnny gosch s abduction  but sarcone said investigators concluded any involvement by bonacci was not credible  here s a short summary of the disturbing case below  on february     in u s  district court in lincoln  nebraska  an extraordinary hearing occurred in paul a  bonacci v  lawrence e  king  a civil action in which the plaintiff charged that he had been ritualistically abused by the defendant  as part of a nationwide pedophile ring linked to powerful political figures in washington and to elements of the u s  military and intelligence establishment  three weeks later  on february   judge warren k  urbom ordered king  who is currently in federal prison  to pay   million in damages to bonacci  in what bonacci s attorney john decamp said was a clear signal that  the evidence presented was credible  the frank and franklin conspiracies outlined above sent shock waves through the establishment in washington  and while it is possible we are seeing another trafficking cover up happening again today  one should consider that thus far  there have been no victims found to have been abused regarding comet ping pong or any other business wrapped up within the online pizzagate theory a franklin cover up documentary called  conspiracy of silence  was made and allegedly pulled from circulation following the fallout from a case that also implicated the catholic founded non profit orphanage  boys town in a related scandal exposed in   the boston globe s spotlight team  first revealed that the leader of the catholic church in boston  cardinal bernard law  allowed one of his priests to continue working even though law knew that fr  john geoghan had spent his career sexually assaulting children  the story became so huge  that it led to more than  priests being publicly named in abuse allegations  covering some  cities in the us and another  globally  in   hollywood released the film spotlight  which chronicled the tales of abuse similarly in the uk  over the past few years  an investigation into the jimmy savile abuse scandal  was compounded by bbc s own cover up of the serious claims  the savile scandal and cover up featured many whistleblowers and victims coming forward  and also showed a high degree of cover up at the police department level as well while observing the connective aspects of various scandals  dc s political scene has also revealed some telling business and establishment links which raise even more interesting questions   media machine    democratic political operative david brock   image source  twitter there are some interesting aspects of pizzagate which have been almost untouched by internet sleuths below we ll take a look at george soros funded media matters and its director david brock and examine his past connections and tangential links to both barney frank and james alefantis media matters    political plotsin   political operative david brock was once a right wing media hit man so to speak  writing conservative op ed s taking on college campus  marxists  and was an investigative reporter for the weekly news magazine insight on the news  published by the washington times   some time later  brock became a democratic political operative and soros righthand man at media matters some reports also claim that brock  seen on the left with barney frank  joined on with sidney blumenthal and the clintons simply over money   but others suggest a different tale   one that took place during the course of brock completing a somewhat strange book entitled  the seduction of hillary clinton   which deflected controversies aimed at the clintons and took a softball approach to hillary s political evolution over the years  many critics have questioned brock s hidden washington past and his unlikely political evolution blackmail  brock  grey   alefantisin   fox news revealed the following  as media matters chief david brock paid a former domestic partner    after being threatened with damaging information involving the organization s donors and the irs   a deal that brock later characterized as a blackmail payment  according to legal documents obtained by foxnews com  brock s bitter separation from william grey led to accusations of blackmail and harassment  in an acrimonious lawsuit settled at the end of last year  brock accused william grey of making repeated threats to expose him to the  scorn or ridicule of his employees  donors and the press in demanding money and property   brock claimed in legal papers that he sold a rehoboth beach  del   home he once shared with grey in order to meet grey s demands  which he called  blackmail  in the lawsuit  brock s legal trouble with grey appeared to be the result of a severed relationship after  years  with brock ending the relationship  he began dating washington  d c   restaurant impresario james alefantis   according to reports considering how brock and grey s end played out according to court records revealed by the media  one might consider that this latest dc drama unfolding in the form of pizzagate  could also be the result of bad jacketing  as suggested by the blog auticulture  after a bitter love triangle involving the trio   in the lead up to one of the most contentious us presidential elections in history according to ward churchill s   agents of repression  the fbi s secret wars against the black panther party and the american indian movement  snitch jacketing or bad jacketing refers to the practice creating suspicion   through the spread of rumors  manufacture of evidence etc bad jacketing had been a technique employed by the fbi under their program cointelpro domestically in america  the fbi created the counter intelligence program known as cointelpro  to influence  disrupt and coerce political factions from the inside out  infiltrating countless political groups and movements  according to reports these included the following   the black panther party  the communist party of america  the ku klux klan  the socialist workers party  the new left  the students for a democratic society  the american indian movement  the chicano movement  the puerto rican liberation movement  communist groups  anti war organizations  hollywood stars sympathetic to these groups  and civil rights leaders  between  and  the fbi s controversial program influenced and radicalized hundreds of left wing and right wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across america  no part of politics was immune to cointelpro is it possible that a dc love triangle that once involved brock  grey   alefantis  led to a pr driven form  as a part of brock s correct the record or something else  of bad jacketing which then cascaded through the democratic party elite  ultimately taking its triangle shape   through the use of pizzagate and others  media control     photo illustration redesigned by wire s shawn helton censorship   the  fake news  witch huntin early november  just prior to the us presidential election  cnn published an article stating the following  a recent buzzfeed study of  hyperpartisan facebook pages  found that these pages  are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information  three weeks later in a republished article written by robert parry from consortium news  it was disclosed that major media companies had been heavily involved in pushing the fake news meme  citing many election based posts made online as the culprit  in its lead editorial on sunday  the new york times decried what it deemed  the digital virus called fake news  and called for internet censorship to counter this alleged problem  taking particular aim at facebook founder mark zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform  below is a passage from a recent report filed at wire discussing the fake news witch hunt  which has now led to new calls for internet censorship  over the past month  the washington post published an irresponsible propaganda piece that blamed the  us election results on  fake news  dispensed via sophisticated russian propaganda  these accusations of course were completely unfounded  deliberately feeding into a paranoid trial by media format that is no doubt echoed by us government sock puppet accounts that act as a digital firing squad by redirecting public perception while the us mainstream media contends that  fake news  somehow altered the  presidential election cycle  it s important to remember that the us government has some pedigree here  having been behind the creation of bogus social media accounts and personalities for years now back in   the uk s guardian reported that the us government via centcom  was looking to gain a foothold over information shared on the internet through fake online personal accounts  the discovery that the us military is developing false online personalities   known to users of social media as  sock puppets    could also encourage other governments  private companies and non government organisations to do the same the centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background  history and supporting details  and that up to  us based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations  without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries   this is just one example  who really knows how widespread this practice is you can expect a litany of allegations to continue from the mainstream  along with their faux war on fake news sites which has been used deliberately to discredit and frame genuine investigative analysis in alternative media  its intended target  western media s anti russian hyperbole has morphed and broadened somewhat  thanks to facebook  google and twitter and the alphabet establishment news agencies  washington has a new go to scapegoat joining the tired old russian  hack  meme   independent media  see also  washington post sloppy  journalism  blames russia for  fake news  crisis and trump s win  while pushing neo mccarthyismit appears as though there has been a coordinated effort to combine the latest run of conspiracies in america  whether it s the fake news meme  the  russian election hack  meme or pizzagate    they all seem to be have been used to undermine key aspects of internet freedom below is an interview with james alefantis featured on megyn kelly s kelly file discussing the highly speculative pizzagate theory  during kelly s interview  the focus centered around unsubstantiated claims levied at the business owner and his place of business here s a very detailed analysis provided by researcher david icke discussing the multi layered theories wrapped up in the pizzagate conspiracy and its relation to censorship and so called  fake news in conclusionthe overtly conspiracy tinged pizzagate theory  emerged like a hydra out of sub reddit and chan threads and twitter posts  while catapulting only the most sensational aspects into the mainstream matrix  the story conjures many hollywood and government tales of cover up  murder  abuse and deception throughout history the perceived presence of a politically charged satanic sex cult intertwined within a paedophilic abuse ring  seemed to have only enhanced the narrative for many internet sleuths  who in some cases  held steadfast to a biased guilt by association meme   even in the absence of any known victims  and without any forensic evidence or any eye witness testimony of a crime this is not to suggest that vip child sex rings and ritual abuse cases do not exist in america  one such murder spree  known as the  son of sam  case  was reopened in part due to evidence of satanic cult activity and multiple offenders  although the findings were suspended  the case was never officially closed while people should certainly have the ability to express their opinion about pizzagate without shame or ridicule  using biased  misleading or fraudulent information  in some cases dispensing defamatory or threatening remarks  in a rapid fire echo chamber  could ultimately undermine any legitimate investigation if there truly was a crime committed here  or elsewhere  if that is the ultimate legacy of pizzagate  then it is a devastating self inflicted wound for the alternative media while it s true that sites like reddit and twitter could cite the  communications decency act  as a protection for hosting defamatory information posts by users  there could be real consequences for those deliberately posting defamatory content with no real evidence to substantiate such allegations another risk with a whirlwind like this  is that it would be very easy for an agent provocateur to post a slick youtube video or craft an article   with the intention of whipping up a storm that could be used to damage independent media as a whole  it s very possible that this has already happened at some point over the life of the internet  and it s certain that the powers that be will use this tactic again in the future above all however  it s important to separate the fallout from the pizzagate story and other fake news allegations  as those in mainstream media such as the new york times  the washington post and the self anointed  fact checker snopes com  seem to have propped up this pizzeria conspiracy as a battle cry to introduce the idea of new internet censorship protocols it s anybody s guess what will be the final outcome of the  pizzagate phenomenon  but for the moment  it seems to have collapsed under the weight of its own mountain of digital ash  maybe that was the idea  read more msm lies at  st century wire msm filessupport wire  subscribe now   become a member
